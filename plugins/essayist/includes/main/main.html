        Technology has brought us to the brink of enormous changes in the way we establish and apply the idea of "truth". As we blaze this new path, though, we're still working from intellectual, moral and psychological landmarks that are as old as human nature.

        Facebookâ€™s evolving services are going to trigger some seismic disruptions in our online lives. Those changes touch on some fundamental issues in how we perceive and interpret the world, but they also give us a pretty good idea of how the online world is going to evolve over the next few years.

        The Internet isn't limited to organizing and annotating virtual files. As we start to "bookmark" the people, places and things around us in the real world, we're running into issues of authenticity and control that go back to the beginnings of religion and myth.

        In the 1970s and '80s, French historian and philosopher named Michel Foucault examined history as a collective <strong>story</strong>, and not as an objective list of facts. That perspective has not only changed how we think about culture &mdash; it exposes some deep implications of new social technologies.

        The "equal and opposite" reaction to the disintegration of the website is going to be the reintegration of persistent, coherent personal identities. That's <strong>not</strong> an endorsement of any company's efforts to own those identities, but &mdash; for better or worse &mdash; it's an enormously powerful consequence of these trends.

<p class="summary">It's not a "click"...it's a <strong>transaction</strong>. What's the underlying value of a "Like" -- for you, for a company, and for Facebook? </p>

<p>The basic model for Liking things through Facebook is pretty simple. You see a "Like" button somewhere online, and -- more and more -- you'll also probably get offered some really strong incentive to click it. If you do click it, you get to make a statement about yourself, and/or show support for an idea or a product...but what's so valuable to the person or group who put the "Like" there in the first place? (And what does Facebook get out of it?) Facebook insists that <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=383515372130" target="_blank">you are not giving up any personal information when you click a "Like" button</a>, but even if we take that statement at face value, there are some very important transactions that take place behind the scenes on every click. Those interactions all contribute to the "value" of a click, and the underlying motives to reap that value are going to fuel (and fund) how this whole thing is going to evolve.

<h1>What's the Value of a Like? </h1>
<h2>"Value" doesn't mean "Money"</h2>
<p>There have already been a lot of attempts to <a href="http://la.irbob.com/duzTuQ">quantify the dollar value of a Like</a>, but while that's an attractive idea -- and a pretty good way to attract attention -- it's really a misguided, pointless effort.
</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why it's pointless to try and do this, but first and foremost, you're automatically placing yourself in a Catch-22. If you're going to generate a specific number like "$3.17", you have to do some combination of these two things:
</p><ol><li><div>You have to guess at arbitrary amounts for things like "How much money is a referral worth?" and "Exactly how much more inclined is a Fan to buy your product?" -- which immediately makes the whole exercise fictional
        </div><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt"><em>or</em>
            </span></p></li><li>You have to base your projections on "real-world" results from a concrete business case -- which immediately makes it so specific that it's pretty much useless (and misleading) in almost <em>any</em> other context
    </li></ol><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">[slider title="SIDE RANT: No, generating estimates like that is <em>not</em> 'consulting' -- "] I am <em>completely</em> aware that management and marketing consultants already spend a lot of time estimating the dollar value of a lead, or the ROI of an e-mail campaign. I'm not dismissing "dollar estimates" out of hand -- it's not only often part of my own job, but I have many close friends and colleagues who do it all the time. My main point is that any credible, experienced consultant works really hard to avoid some really basic pitfalls...especially the two that I just pointed out. If you're going to build a credible model, you do it within a <em>very</em> specific context, and then try to feed it with <em>very</em> concrete, relevant assumptions. Basically, no consultant worth their salt would start with a ridiculously broad premise such as "Hey, let's try and calculate a universal dollar value for a Like". <em>That's</em> the problem. (And yes, I'm also aware that people have been trying to calculate the absolute dollar value of an "e-mail open" or a "banner ad click-through" ever since those things have been around. Equally bad ideas.) [/slider]
    </span></p><p>Beyond that, there's the simple fact that the act of Liking means completely different things in different contexts. Announcing that you Like Butterfinger Candy Bars makes it a pretty safe bet that you'll buy one soon, but what does it mean if you Like this blog? What about if you Like a book or an album that you've already bought? Those actions all "mean" something, but you've got to look at a lot more than dollar amounts to get a sense of <em>what</em> they mean.
</p><h2>"Value" means "Getting What You Want"
</h2><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">The real value of a Like is defined by how well it serves a three-way set of competing agendas -- you, whoever set up the "Like" button, and Facebook.
    </span></p><p><img src="http://lairbob.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Three-way_Tug_Dogs_Detail_100518.png" alt=""/><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Note that those agendas aren't necessarily conflicting with one another, they're competing. There's always room for a healthy give-and-take between the parties in a negotiation, and the best path to some kind of win-win -- or at least to protecting your own interests -- is by understanding what's at stake.
    </span></p><h3>The psychological dimension
</h3><p>The first set of issues surround the social and emotional implications of your choice. What does it mean to perform such a public gesture, and proclaim your loyalty to a person, a place, a product or an idea? There are a number of psychological mechanisms at play. (Or, "at work", depending on how you want to look at it. Sorry.)
</p><h4>Managing our intellectual metabolism
</h4><p>While we all like to think that we make up our own minds, the reality is that even our "personal decisions" are made through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism">a highly social process</a>. We don't just "take other people's advice" – we're all engaged in a collective effort to define a shared view of the world around us. Those collective definitions are, quite literally, our "common ground". They are the only reason that we can think about and act within the world together.
</p><p>That fundamental process of how we gather and construct our perception of the world has been explored most prominently by the developmental psychologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget">Jean Piaget</a> (among others, obviously), through a school of thought that's often called "Constructivism". As you can tell from the name, one of its key tenets is that we don't start with a built-in understanding of the world ("essentialism"), or somehow "absorb" pre-existing facts over time ("objectivism"). Instead, Constructivism maintains that we each slowly build our own internal model of the world, but that we share a common set of cognitive tools to do that, and we each pass through a common set of phases as that model grows. "Social Constructivism", as a discipline, focuses on how many (or even most) of those cognitive tools are deeply <em>social</em>.
</p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">[slider title="Piaget and his theories – "]
    </span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">While Piaget remains a huge figure in developmental theory, there's been a lot of work done since his work in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. Piaget defined a very rigid set of developmental phases that he felt everyone goes through, and many psychologists now feel that <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_1.html">he over-generalized</a>. He also focused primarily on cognitive development from infancy through adolescence, without looking as closely at how those same mechanisms continue to guide our thinking as "mature" adults.
    </span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Also, while Constructivism has become a predominant model for cognitive development, as you might assume, it isn't universally accepted. Personally, though, I've always found it to be highly convincing. For one thing, there is a <em>ton</em> of research to support it. (Much of it done by Piaget. He had a brilliant knack for devising simple, convincing experiments to test his theories.) More importantly, it just seems very clearly supported by my own personal experiences, as a student and as a teacher.
    </span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">[slider]
    </span></p><p>Setting aside a more comprehensive exploration of social / cognitive tools (for now), the key point is this -- the information that we gather through our social relationships influences our thinking on a very, very deep level. There's a common tendency to think of social influence as a primarily "conscious" or semi-conscious process. ("Oh, look! Mark likes that band. I should go check out their new album on iTunes.") That top-of-mind processing definitely happens, and it's important. But we also need to be aware of the fact that when someone we know and trusts makes an emphatic assertion about the world, then it doesn't really matter whether or not we consciously "think" a lot about what they just said. There are deeper cognitive processes that respond to that new piece information on an almost autonomic level, and start figuring out how to take it into account. Does it conflict with your existing interpretation of the world? Does it expand it? Does it reinforce your confidence in some aspect of your mental model?
</p><p>Piaget and other developmental theorists have examined these processes in great detail, including how techniques such as "assimilation" and "accommodation" continually revise and extend our cognitive model of the world. Most importantly, though, those processes are all extremely sensitive to <em>context</em>. Information that comes in through a reliable context is basically given "the benefit of the doubt", and treated as something that automatically <em>should</em> become part of what Piaget called our "mental schema".
</p><p>Maybe the most useful analogy is digestion and metabolism. When your body is metabolizing food, it doesn't really matter how much you "thought" about the food as you were eating it. Sure, your conscious awareness might affect how <em>much</em> you eat, or your emotional state, but once that steak hits your stomach it kicks off a set of autonomic processes that aren't really affected by your thoughts. The proteins, carbohydrates and fats you ingested are going to be "taken into account", and your body will be different somehow as a result. Not dramatically because of one meal, but over time, those autonomic processes are the ones that most directly define who we <em>are</em> physically.
</p><p>In the same way, these deep cognitive tools directly define our interpretation of the world…and whether or not we're paying attention to them, they're <em>always</em> paying attention. Every single piece of evidence that we're exposed to about what our friends think, or how they behave, gets factored into our mental schema one way or another, just like every morsel of food we eat gets metabolized. Similarly, just as the <em>volume</em> of food we metabolize over time can add up to a dramatic impact (for better or worse), continual exposure to assertions about what our friends and family "Like" can't help but influence how we understand the world. Whether or not

</h3><ul><li>You become part of a statistical audience that a marketer can use some very cool tools to analyse and understand more closely. Whether or not the company ever identifies you individually, any of your profile data that you've agreed to share more broadly -- like maybe your favorite bands, or the sites you tend to share links from -- become data points for them.

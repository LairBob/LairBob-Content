    Technology has brought us to the brink of enormous changes in the way we establish and apply the idea of "truth". As we blaze this new path, though, we're still working from intellectual, moral and psychological landmarks that are as old as human nature. From the subterranean revelations of myth to the elaborate formal insights of post-modernism, the thoughts and emotions of the past are still the foundation on which we'll build our future truths.

<h1>The More Things Change&hellip;</h1>
<p>Obviously, science and technology have always challenged and evolved what we're willing to collectively accept as "true", and the consequences of that process have continually shaped society far beyond the boundaries of scientific thought. Nevertheless, the changes that we're facing as a result of modern technologies are introducing new and dramatic dimensions to</p>

<h1>&hellip;The More They Stay The Same</h1>
<p>At the same time, as these new truths take shape in our society, they collide directly with the fundamental issues of our human condition. No matter how radically the conditions of our existence may change, the cognitive and emotional tools we use to come to terms with those conditions go back to the very beginnings of how we think, speak and act. We have struggled with agonizing questions of identity, morality and meaning at every point of our collective history, and the products of that struggle — our myths, our religions, our philosophies and our sciences — are the best sources of insight and guidance that we have for moving forward.</p>
<p>The thoughts and beliefs of the past don't just help us recognize old issues in new clothes, though. They throw the outlines of our [new challenges] into sharp relief, and force us to acknowledge the real scope of the changes we're facing.</p>
<h2>The Truths That Emerge Through Belief</h2>
<p>Throughout history, we have always recognized the power of thoughts, emotions and beliefs that overwhelm the bounds of reason. Whether on an individual level — through dreams, meditative trances or ecstatic seizures — or on a collective level — through myth, religion and fable — we've never insisted that we have to be able to explain something in order to accept its influence over who we are and what we do. Most importantly, we know that the [truths / ideas] that come to light through those deep channels have a distilled, lapidary strength. The figures of myth, the gestures of ritual all stem from our need to confront the central terms of our existence.</p>
<p>At the same time, as I wrestle with these issues of , three central figures from classical mythology come to mind, over and over:</p>
<h3>Janus: The Divided Gatekeeper</h3>
<p>The first may seem a bit facile at first, but I find it deeply relevant. Janus was not only charged with looking into the past and the future, but as the god of transitions and beginnings, he was responsible for how well the lessons of the past bore fruit in the future. Janus was the god of augury, of searching for small hints that foretold big changes, and the gatekeeper to a better future. For centuries, the gates of the Janus shrine stood as a figurative barrier between peace and war — during times of war, they stood open to represent the threat of attack, and they were closed in times of peace.</p>
